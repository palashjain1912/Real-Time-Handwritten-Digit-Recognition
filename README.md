# Real-Time-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

●	Analyzed 70,000 images of handwritten digits. Developed data processing pipeline by normalizing data, removing color dimension and performing image augmentation using modern machine learning algorithms and scientific computing libraries (TensorFlow and Keras) to ingest data in dense neural network


●	Implemented Convolution, Max pooling, and Transfer learning networks, incorporated OpenCV module to capture images from webcam, to forecast digits with 98% accuracy
